This lab aims to test your programming skills in Machine Learning. 

You will need to: 
1. Choose one of the classification datasets from the UCI repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) 
2. Select two classification models from the following list: 
- Logistic Regression (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html)
- Decision Tree Classifier (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)
- Bayesian Classifier (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html)
3. Implement these models yourself without using any external libraries 
4. Compare your results with the sklearn implementations 
5. Write the report with the results of different implementations comparison and conclusions

The lab folder contains an example implementation of a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier and a comparison with the sklearn implementation.
