In this lab, you will analyze a dataset using clustering techniques. The lab folder contains an example of clustering the Wine dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets/wine). 

To complete the lab, you need to: 
1. Select any classification dataset from the UCI repository. 
2. Create your own quality metric to measure the performance of clustering algorithms based on the correct labels in the classification dataset. 
3. Remove the labels in the training dataset for use with clustering algorithms. 
4. Apply various clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN) and compare them using your custom metric. Note: You will need to experiment with different numbers of clusters, regardless of the number of unique labels in the original dataset. 
5. Analyze the results of clustering: 
    - Compare clusters between each other based on differences in features 
    - Identify outliers if any 
    - Analyze the internal structure of clusters
6. Prepare a report based on the results of the analysis.
